 📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for a telecom dataset. Using Python visualization libraries and an interactive Power BI dashboard, it uncovers customer behavior patterns and identifies factors influencing churn.

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Loading & Cleaning

Imported the Telcom Customer Churn dataset.

Handled missing values and identified categorical vs numerical columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized churn distribution.

Analyzed correlations between tenure, contract type, internet service, tech support, and churn.

Compared churn rates across categorical features (e.g., gender, partner, payment method).

Data Visualization

Used Matplotlib & Seaborn for plots: bar charts, heatmaps, and distributions.

Highlighted churn trends across demographics and service usage.

Dashboard (Power BI)

Built an interactive dashboard for executives to monitor churn rate, customer segments, and risk factors.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🔑 Key Insights

Customers with short tenure are more likely to churn.

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.

Customers without tech support show a higher likelihood of leaving.
